                Hello, My name is Michael Brima. As the current holder of a Bachelors Degree of Science in Industrial Engineering, I am looking
                for Web Development jobs to practice my skills and become more accustomed to the field. I
                have experience creating coding projects in SQL as well as in Front End coding languages such
                as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap JavaScript (including JavaScript libraries like JQuery), and PHP. I am
                also familiar with back-end technologies as well including Node.js, Express, JSON, Fetch
                Requests, RESTful APIs, and MongoDB as well as developing code in software and programs
                well known to web development including Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code (or Visual Studio
                Code), Laragon, and PhpMyAdmin. These projects can be found on my GitHub page
                (https://github.com/Michaelbrima/). I’m looking for a role where I can gain experience and
                expertise in coding. I’m curious about learning more frameworks and languages and becoming
                able to use them and put them to use in new projects in new and interesting ways that can help to
                further my career. Though I am new to web development and software engineering in general, I
                would certainly give it my all to learn as much as I can as a new, curious and eager Web
                developer.
